# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create purchase classification module with AI integration







  - Implement `classifyPurchase` function that calls OpenAI API with focused classification prompt
  - Add error handling with fallback to DISCRETIONARY_SMALL classification
  - Include price-based validation rules (>$300 = HIGH_VALUE)
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 2. Implement session-based caching for classification results







  - Create in-memory cache with item name and cost as composite key
  - Add cache expiration and LRU eviction logic (max 100 entries)
  - Implement cache hit/miss logic to avoid redundant API calls
  - _Requirements: 2.5_

- [x] 3. Create category-specific prompt template system





  - Implement `getPromptForCategory` function with three distinct prompt templates
  - ESSENTIAL_DAILY template: Quick, practical advice in 2 sentences max
  - DISCRETIONARY_SMALL template: Cost-benefit analysis with behavioral nudges
  - HIGH_VALUE template: Full analytical treatment with detailed reasoning
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [x] 4. Integrate classification into existing enhanced recommendation flow







  - Modify `getEnhancedPurchaseRecommendation` to call classification before AI prompt
  - Replace generic prompt with category-specific prompt from template system
  - Ensure all existing return fields are maintained (decision, summary, reasoning, quote, analysisDetails, decisionMatrix)
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 4.1, 4.3_

- [ ] 5. Add comprehensive error handling and graceful degradation
  - Implement fallback behavior when classification API fails
  - Add error logging for network, parsing, and timeout scenarios
  - Ensure system continues with existing behavior when classification unavailable
  - _Requirements: 2.4, 4.2, 4.4_

- [ ] 6. Create unit tests for classification functionality
  - Test `classifyPurchase` with known item types: "Purell disinfecting wipes" ($7) → ESSENTIAL_DAILY
  - Test "AmazonBasics phone case" ($15) → DISCRETIONARY_SMALL
  - Test "MacBook Air M3" ($1299) → HIGH_VALUE
  - Test error scenarios and fallback behavior
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [ ] 7. Create unit tests for prompt templates and caching
  - Test each category generates appropriate prompt structure and length
  - Test cache functionality with hit/miss scenarios and expiration
  - Test integration with existing recommendation system maintains backward compatibility
  - _Requirements: 3.5, 2.5_

- [ ] 8. Integration testing and validation
  - Test complete flow from purchase input through classification to final recommendation
  - Verify existing API contracts and response formats remain unchanged
  - Test system behavior under various failure scenarios (network issues, invalid responses)
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_
