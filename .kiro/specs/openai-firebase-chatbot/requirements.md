# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves building a chatbot application using React Next.js framework that leverages OpenAI's API for natural language processing and conversation capabilities, hosted on Firebase for scalable cloud deployment. The chatbot will provide users with an interactive conversational interface that can understand and respond to user queries using OpenAI's language models.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to send messages to the chatbot, so that I can have a conversation and get responses to my questions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types a message THEN the system SHALL accept the input and display it in the chat interface
2. WHEN a user submits a message THEN the system SHALL send the message to OpenAI API and display the response
3. WHEN the OpenAI API responds THEN the system SHALL display the response in the chat interface within 10 seconds
4. WHEN a user sends multiple messages THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation context and history

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a clean and intuitive chat interface, so that I can easily interact with the chatbot.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the chatbot THEN the system SHALL display a chat interface with message input field and send button
2. WHEN messages are exchanged THEN the system SHALL display user messages and bot responses in a clear, distinguishable format
3. WHEN the chat history grows THEN the system SHALL automatically scroll to show the latest messages
4. WHEN the system is processing a request THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the chatbot to be securely deployed on Firebase using Next.js, so that it can handle multiple users reliably and securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is deployed THEN the system SHALL be accessible via Firebase hosting with Next.js static export or Firebase Functions
2. WHEN users access the chatbot THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent users without performance degradation
3. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL securely store and use OpenAI API keys in server-side environment variables without exposing them to clients
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log errors appropriately and display user-friendly error messages
5. WHEN the Next.js application is built THEN the system SHALL be optimized for Firebase deployment

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the chatbot to handle errors gracefully, so that I have a smooth experience even when issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the OpenAI API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message to the user
2. WHEN network connectivity is poor THEN the system SHALL retry requests and inform users of connection issues
3. WHEN API rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL queue requests or inform users to wait
4. WHEN invalid input is provided THEN the system SHALL validate input and provide helpful feedback

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the chatbot to be configurable, so that I can adjust settings like model parameters and conversation behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the application THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of OpenAI model parameters (temperature, max tokens, etc.)
2. WHEN setting up the chatbot THEN the system SHALL allow customization of system prompts and personality
3. WHEN managing the application THEN the system SHALL provide environment-based configuration for different deployment stages
4. WHEN monitoring usage THEN the system SHALL track API usage and costs appropriately
