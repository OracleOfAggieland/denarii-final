# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves a comprehensive cleanup of the project to remove unnecessary test files, debugging files, and refactor code to improve maintainability and reduce complexity. The cleanup will focus on removing development artifacts that are no longer needed while preserving essential functionality and improving code organization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove all test files from the project, so that the codebase is cleaner and focused only on production code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the cleanup is complete THEN the system SHALL have no test files remaining in the src directory
2. WHEN test files are removed THEN the system SHALL remove all associated test dependencies from package.json
3. WHEN test files are removed THEN the system SHALL remove jest configuration files
4. WHEN test files are removed THEN the system SHALL update .gitignore to remove test-related entries if no longer needed

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove debugging files and console statements, so that the production code is clean and doesn't contain development artifacts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN debugging cleanup is complete THEN the system SHALL have no console.log, console.debug, console.warn statements in production code
2. WHEN debugging cleanup is complete THEN the system SHALL preserve only essential console.error statements for actual error handling
3. WHEN debugging cleanup is complete THEN the system SHALL remove any debugging-specific files or utilities
4. WHEN debugging cleanup is complete THEN the system SHALL remove validation and testing scripts from the scripts directory

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to refactor and consolidate code, so that the codebase follows the development philosophy of minimalism and maintainability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code refactoring is complete THEN the system SHALL consolidate duplicate or similar functionality into single implementations
2. WHEN code refactoring is complete THEN the system SHALL remove unused imports and dependencies
3. WHEN code refactoring is complete THEN the system SHALL simplify complex file structures where possible
4. WHEN code refactoring is complete THEN the system SHALL ensure all remaining code follows the YAGNI principle
5. WHEN code refactoring is complete THEN the system SHALL maintain clear separation of concerns between different modules

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to clean up configuration and documentation files, so that only essential project files remain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration cleanup is complete THEN the system SHALL remove redundant environment files
2. WHEN configuration cleanup is complete THEN the system SHALL consolidate similar configuration files
3. WHEN configuration cleanup is complete THEN the system SHALL remove development-specific documentation that's no longer relevant
4. WHEN configuration cleanup is complete THEN the system SHALL update package.json to remove unused scripts and dependencies

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove any unused files not critical to the execution of the web app, so that the project contains only essential files for production functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unused file cleanup is complete THEN the system SHALL identify and remove any files not directly used by the web application
2. WHEN unused file cleanup is complete THEN the system SHALL preserve only files that are imported or referenced by the application
3. WHEN unused file cleanup is complete THEN the system SHALL remove any orphaned or standalone files that don't contribute to core functionality
4. WHEN unused file cleanup is complete THEN the system SHALL maintain only the minimal set of files required for the web app to function properly
