# Pro Mode Hint System Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a user-friendly hint system for the Pro Mode questionnaire that allows users to reveal hints for each question and easily use those hints as their answers.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Hint Toggle Functionality
- Added a lightbulb icon (ðŸ’¡) next to each question
- Clicking the icon toggles the visibility of the hint for that specific question
- Each question's hint state is managed independently
- Proper accessibility attributes with dynamic aria-labels and titles

### 2. Hint Display
- When visible, hints appear in a styled container below the question
- Hints use the existing `placeholder` text from the question objects
- Smooth slide-down animation when hints appear/disappear
- Visually distinct styling with gradient background and border

### 3. "Use Hint" Button
- When a hint is visible, a "Use Hint" button appears
- Clicking the button populates the answer textarea with the hint text
- Button has hover effects and proper focus states for accessibility

### 4. State Management
- Added `visibleHints` state to track which hints are currently shown
- Added `toggleHint()` function to show/hide hints independently
- Added `useHint()` function to populate answers with hint text
- All state changes are properly managed and don't interfere with existing functionality

## Code Changes

### ProMode.js
- Added `visibleHints` state object
- Added `toggleHint(questionId)` function
- Added `useHint(questionId, hintText)` function
- Modified question rendering to include hint toggle button and hint section
- Updated question structure with proper accessibility attributes

### ProMode.css
- Added comprehensive styling for the hint system:
  - `.hint-toggle` - Styling for the lightbulb button
  - `.hint-section` - Container for the hint content with animation
  - `.hint-content` - Styled hint display area
  - `.hint-label` - "Hint:" label styling
  - `.hint-text` - Hint text styling
  - `.use-hint-button` - Button to use the hint as answer
- Added responsive design considerations for mobile devices
- Enhanced existing animations and added new slideDown animation

## User Experience Flow

1. **Revealing a Hint**: User clicks the ðŸ’¡ icon next to any question
2. **Hint Display**: Hint appears below the question with smooth animation
3. **Using the Hint**: User clicks "Use Hint" button to populate their answer
4. **Independent Operation**: Each question's hint works independently
5. **Hiding Hints**: Clicking the ðŸ’¡ icon again hides the hint

## Accessibility Features

- Proper ARIA labels that update based on hint visibility state
- Keyboard navigation support for all interactive elements
- Screen reader friendly with descriptive labels
- Focus management and visual focus indicators
- Semantic HTML structure

## Design Principles Followed

- **Clarity**: Distinct visual elements that are easy to understand
- **Smoothness**: Animated transitions for fluid user experience
- **Accessibility**: Full keyboard and screen reader support
- **Cohesion**: Integrated seamlessly with existing design system
- **Minimalism**: Clean, unobtrusive interface that doesn't overwhelm

## Technical Implementation

- Uses React hooks for state management
- CSS animations for smooth transitions
- Responsive design that works on all screen sizes
- Maintains existing functionality without breaking changes
- Follows existing code patterns and conventions

## Testing

Created comprehensive test suite (`ProMode.test.js`) covering:
- Hint toggle functionality
- Independent hint state management
- "Use Hint" button behavior
- Accessibility attributes
- User interaction flows

The implementation successfully delivers all requested functionality while maintaining code quality and user experience standards.
